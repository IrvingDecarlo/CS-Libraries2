Cephei C# (.Net) Libraries Version 2,
created and maintained by Irving Decarlo.


INTRODUCTION

The original CS-Libraries project was initially created for my own personal use back in 2019. However, I was an inexperienced C# developer back then, so the original library fell short from my expectations.

Hence, in late 2020, I scrapped the original library and rewrote everything from scratch, thus dawning this current new version, the CS-Libraries2 project.
